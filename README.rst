Tweet Impact Predictor


Description
===========

A natural language processing pipeline for predicting the impact (reach and popularity) of a tweet.
Built as part of the PyCon 2016 Natural Language Processing tutorial and workshop.
For more information see the parent git repository at https://github.com/totalgood/pycon-2016-nlp-tutorial.

Don't install the latest version from PyPi if you are working through the tutorial yourself! Tagged version numbers will correspond to sections of the tutorial and handout material so you can maintain pace even if you miss a step along the way.

GETTING STARTED
===============

If you don't already have one, sign up to get a twitter user account (@username): twitter.com/signup_

Once you have a user account, set up a twitter App with an API KEY: apps.twitter.com/app/new_
