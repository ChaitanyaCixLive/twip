# Lesson 2

## Got Features?

## Finding Features in Tweet Dumps (json, csv)


# Workshop 2

1. Tokenize Your Tweets
    - case normalization
    - ignore URLs and punctuation
    - transcode smilies?
2. Compile a Vocabulary
    - Count word frequencies
    - Plot a Zipf plot of word frequencies
    - Plot a Zipf plot of document frequencies
3. Compute the TFIDF
    - Term frequency in each tweet
    - Document frequency (which tweets contain the term)
